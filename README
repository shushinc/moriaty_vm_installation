## System requirements

The control node must have Ansible 8.0+ (ansible-core 2.15+)

All managed nodes in inventory must have:

Passwordless SSH access
Root access (or a user with equivalent permissions)

## Usage

1. Start by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shushinc/moriaty_vm_installation.git
```
2. Edit the inventory file to add the `ansible_user` you created during the prerequisites:
```bash
vim inventory.yml

ansible_user: ansible
```
3. In the root directory, run the Ansible playbook to provision the cluster:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/sites.yaml -i inventory.yml --tags mysql
ansible-playbook playbook/sites.yaml -i inventory.yml --tags moriarty
```
